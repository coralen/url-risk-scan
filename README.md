# url-risk-scan
This proejct helps manage the risk level of suspicious urls.
By adding an url to the file 'urls.csv', you'll be able to get scan results for this url in the next run of the project.
For resource usage efficiency, the project will only scan a url if it hasn't been scanned for the past 30 minutes.
